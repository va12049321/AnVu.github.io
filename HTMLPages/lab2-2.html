        <h2>Your Five Business Introduction Rules</h2>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><strong>Stand Up:</strong> When you are seated and someone approaches you to say "hello" with a handshake, stand up, whether you are a man or woman. By doing so, you show the person you are greeting that they are worth your full atention.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Eye Contact:</strong> By looking directly in the eye, you acccomplish three things:
            <p><ul style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>You will project an image of self-confidence and a healthy self-esteem.</li>
            <li>You will be perceived as a good listener.</li>
            <li>You willl probably receive the same courtesy when you speek.</li>
            </ul>
                </li></p>
        <li><strong>Smite:</strong> It sends others a message of acceptance.</li>
        <li><strong>Say Your Name:</strong> If you are meeting someone for the first time you should introduce yourself using your first and last name.</li>
        <lo><strong>Shake Hands:</strong> Generally speaking, a handshake should last only as long as it takes to greet the person. It should be firm enough to display your sense of confidence without being a bonecrusher.</lo>
        </ol>
        <h2>Creating a BAD First Impression</h2>
       
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
        <li><strong>Sloppy Language:</strong> No matter how well you dress, using sloppy language will lessen your credibility with       other. For example saying "yeah" instead of "yes", or using profanity, especially around people that would not find it impressive. Most people consider your choice of words a direct reflection on your intelligence.</li>
        <li><strong>Giggling:</strong> While laughter can be the bst medicine for many ills, gigling can be annoying.</li>
        <li><strong>Hiding your Hands:</strong> believe it or not, etiquette research has shown that hands above board arer more appealing than hands hidden away in pockets. When your hands are not showing, it often sends a signal to someone that you are not telling all or that you are holding something back.</li>
        <li><strong>Gum-Chewing:</strong> Let there be no doubt about it, you should not chew gum when meeting peoplel. Not excaptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Throat Clearing:</strong> The habit of clearing your throat several times during a conversation can be very distracting.</li>    
        </ul>
