        <li>Define the Problem</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>This step involves gathering the requirements of the program needed to solve the problem </li>
            <li>Questions that should be answered:</li>
                <ol type="a" >
                <li>What data do we need to process?</li>
                <li>How should we process the data?</li>
                <li>What output should the program deliver?</li>
                <li>How should the user interface look?</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
        <li>Design the Program</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>Progran design focuses on breaking down the progarm into smaller, more manageable components. Various tools are used to help design a program.</li>
            <li>Commonly used tools:</li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
                <li>Structure Charts</li>
                <li>Algorithm</li>
                <li>Flow Charts</li>
                <li>Decision Tables</li>
                <li>Pseduocode</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        <li>Code the Program</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>Once the program has been designed, a developer then writes the code.</li>
            <li>Coding often involves translating the design from charts and pseduocode into a specific programming language. Usually the language is chosen during the "defining" stage.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Testing and Debugging</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li> After code has been written this stage revolves around fixing any bugs in the program.</li>
            <li>There are two kinds of errors that cause bugs:</li>    
                <ol type="a">
                <li>Syntax Errors: These are like grammatical mistakes in the code.</li>
                <li>Logical Error: These are mistakes might cause an other than intented output the code still works.</li>
                </ol>
            <li>The programmer must fix these mistakes by carefully examining the already written code for errors.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Documentation</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>After coding has been completed, the programmer must write a manyak tgat generally contains the following:</li>
                <ol type="a" >
                <li>An overview of the programs functionality.</li>
                <li>In-depth explanations of program features.</li>
                <li>Documentation of all commands.</li>
                <li>A thorough desciption of error messages generated by the program.</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
        <li>Deploying and Maintaining the Program</li> 
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>A software team will be responsible foro fixing new errors and updating the software with new features.</li>
            <li>When a new feature should be added to the program, the cycle restarts as developers begin to define what problem the new fature will solve.</li>
